James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend Forever) were bored. They had played all day but now that it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do.
They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home.
“I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another game of – of something.”
Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.”
“I was just going to say that,” James said. “Yah, I’ll bet,” replied his sister. “You always say you were thinking of whatever I think of,” she snapped. “Do not!” James said in a loud voice. “Do too,” yelled Sally.
Mark just looked down at the ground and shook his head from side to side. “They are at it again,” he mumbled to himself. Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek
I’ll be the seeker!”
He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud. “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 …..” Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.
In the distance they could still hear Mark counting
“4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here
I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places
where they could be hiding.
